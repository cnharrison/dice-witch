# Dice Witch

Dice Witch is a highly advanced bot that rolls dice on Discord. It displays the dice visually, and aims to simulate the sensory user experience of rolling real dice.

You can install Dice Witch on your Discord server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=808161585876697108&permissions=0&scope=bot).

# Usage

## Basic rolls
You can roll any of the traditional dice that exist IRL with Dice Witch--four, six, eight, ten, twelve, or twenty-sided dice.The reason for this restriction is that dice are displayed as images in Discord. 

  - `!roll 1d4 3d6 1d20`: Roll one four-sided die, three six-sided dice, and one twenty-sided die.
  - `!roll 1d12+3 5d4`: Roll one twelve-sided die, adding three to the total, and five four sided dice. 
  - `!roll 3d6+3d6`: Roll two sets of three six-sided die and add the total. 
  You can also subtract `-`, multiply `*`, and divide `/` rolls.

## Advanced rolls
You can use (almost) any of these modifiers in conjunction with any other modifiers. 

### Min/Max
Cause any rolls above/below the value to be treated as equal to the minimum/maximum value.
  - `!roll 4d6min3`: Roll four d6 where values less than three are treated as equal to three.
  - `!roll 4d10max5`: Roll four d10 where values greater than five are treated as equal to five.

### Exploding
Allows one or more dice to be re-rolled (Usually when it rolls the highest possible number on the die), with each successive roll being added to the total.
  - `!roll 2d6!=5`: Roll two d6 and explode on any roll equal to five.
  - `!roll 2d!>4`: Roll two d6 and explode on any roll greater than four. 
  - `!roll 4d10!<=3`: Roll four d10 and explode on any roll less than or equal to three. 

#### Compounding
Just like exploding, but exploded dice will be combined together in a single roll instead of being re-rolled. You can mark exploding dice to compound by using  `!!` instead of `!`
  - `!roll 2d6!!=5`: Roll two d6 and explode and compound on any roll equal to five.
#### Penetrating
A type of exploding dice most comonly used in the Hackmaster system. 
>Should you roll the maximum value on this particular die, you may re-roll and add the result of the extra die, less one point, to the total (penetration can actually result in simply the maximum die value if a 1 is subsequently rolled, since any fool knows that 1-1=0). This process continues indefinitely as long as the die in question continues to come up maximum (but thereâ€™s always only a â€“1 subtracted from the extra die, even if itâ€™s, say, the third die of penetration)

You can mark exploding dice to penetrate by using `!p` instead of `!`. 
- `!roll 2d6!p!=5`: Roll two d6 and explode and penetrate on any roll equal to five.


### Re-roll
Rerolls a die that rolls the lowest posible number on that die, until a number greater than the minimum is rolled. 

- `!roll 1d10r`: Roll 1d10 and reroll on one. 
- `!roll 4d10r<=3`: Roll 4d10 and reroll on any result less than or equal to three. 

### Keep/Drop AKA Advantage
Disregard or keep all dice above or below a certain threshold. 
- `!roll 4d10k2`: Roll 4d10 and keep the highest two rolls
- `!roll 4d10k2l`: Roll 4d10 and keep the lowest two rolls.  

- `!roll 4d10d1`: Roll 4d10 and disregard the lowest roll.
- `!Roll 4d10d1h`: Roll 4d10 and disregard the highest roll

### Target success/failure AKA Dice pool
Counts the number of dice that meet a criterion
- `!roll 2d6=6`: Roll 2d6 and count the number of dice that equal six
- `!roll 6d10<=4`: Roll 6d10 and count the number of dice that are less than or equal to four

### Critical success/failure 
This is an aesthetic feature that makes it super clear when a die has rolled the highest or lowest possible value. It makes no differnce to the roll or its value.

- `!roll 1d20cs`: Roll 1d20 and highlight if result is 20 
- `!roll 5d20cs>=16`: Roll 5d20 and highlight if result is greater than 16
- `!roll 1d20cf`: Roll 1d20 and highlight result is 1

### Sorting

You can append an `s` flag to any of your rolls to sort the in aseending or descending numerical order. 

- `!roll 4d6`: Roll 4d6 and do not sort
- `!roll 4d6s`: Roll 4d6 and sort results in asending order
- `!roll 4d6sa`: Same as above
- `!roll 4d6sd`: Roll 4d6 and sort results in descending order

## Math 

You can use add, subtract, multiply, divide, and use parenthesis as you please. You can also reduce and use the following JS math functions: `abs, ceil, cos, exp, floor, log, max, min, pow, round, sign, sin, sqrt, tan`

- `!roll d6*5`: Roll a d6 and multiply the reslt by 5 
- `!roll 2d10/d20`: Roll 2d20 and add the result together, then roll a d20 and divide the two totals
- `!roll 3d20^4 `: Roll 3d20 and raise the result to the power of 4
- `!roll (4-2)d10`: Subtract 2 from 4 and then roll a d10 that many times 
- `!roll sqrt(4d10/3)`: Roll 4d10, divide by three and calculate the square root


## Group rolls 

You can perform rolls groups using comma separated sub-roll expressions. The sub-roll results will be summed together and modifiers can be run on entire expressions, rather than individual die rolls.
- `!roll {4d6, 2d10, d4}`
- `!roll {3d8*2, 20/2d10, 2d10-d4}`: 

## Extras 

### Titled rolls

  - `!titledroll 1d20`: Roll one twenty-sided die with a title. You'll be prompted for the title after typing the command, and the roll will only be perfomed once you've given it. Any `!roll` can also be a `!titledroll`. You have 30 seconds to answer the prompt.
