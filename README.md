# Dice Witch

Dice Witch is a highly advanced bot that rolls dice on Discord. It displays the dice visually, and aims to simulate the sensory user experience of rolling real dice.

# Usage

## Basic rolls
You can roll any of the traditinal dice that exist IRL with Dice Witch--four, six, eight, ten, twelve, or twenty-sided dice.
  - `!roll 1d4 3d6 1d20`: Roll one four-sided die, three six-sided dice, and one twenty-sided die.
  - `!roll 1d12+3 5d4`: Roll one twelve-sided die, adding three to the total, and five four sided dice. 
  - `!roll 3d6+3d6`: Roll two sets of three six-sided die and add the total. 
  You can also subtract `-`, multiply `*`, and divide `/` rolls.

## Advanced rolls

### Min/Max
Cause any rolls above/below the value to be treated as equal to the minimum/maximum value.
  - `!roll 4d6min3`: Roll four d6 where values less than three are treated as equal to three.
  - `!roll 4d10max5`: Roll four d10 where values greater than five are treated as equal to five.

### Exploding
Allows one or more dice to be re-rolled (Usually when it rolls the highest possible number on the die), with each successive roll being added to the total.
  - `!roll 2d6!=5`: Roll two d6 and explode on any roll equal to five.
  - `!roll 2d!>4`: Roll two d6 and explode on any roll greater than four. 
  - `!roll 4d10!<=3`: Roll four d10 and explode on any roll less than or equal to three. 
#### Compounding
Just like exploding, but exploded dice will be combined together in a single roll instead of being re-rolled. You can mark exploding dice to compound by using  `!!` instead of `!`
  - `!roll 2d6!!=5`: Roll two d6 and explode and compound on any roll equal to five.
#### Penetrating
A type of exploding dice most comonly used in the Hackmaster system. 
>Should you roll the maximum value on this particular die, you may re-roll and add the result of the extra die, less one point, to the total (penetration can actually result in simply the maximum die value if a 1 is subsequently rolled, since any fool knows that 1-1=0). This process continues indefinitely as long as the die in question continues to come up maximum (but thereâ€™s always only a â€“1 subtracted from the extra die, even if itâ€™s, say, the third die of penetration)

You can mark exploding dice to penetrate by using `!p` instead of `!`. 
- `!roll 2d6!p!=5`: Roll two d6 and explode and penetrate on any roll equal to five.

### Re-roll
Rerolls a die that rolls the lowest posible number on that die, until a number greater than the minimum is rolled. 

- `!roll 1d10r`: Roll 1d10 and reroll on one. 
- `!roll 4d10r<=3`: Roll 4d10 and reroll on any result less than or equal to three. 

## Keep/Drop


## Extras 
### Titled rolls

  - `!titledroll 1d20`: Roll one twenty-sided die with a title. You'll be prompted for the title after typing the command, and the roll will only be perfomed once you've given it. Any `!roll` can also be a `!titledroll`. You have 30 seconds to answer the prompt.
